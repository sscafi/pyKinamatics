# Kinematics Simulator

A Python-based kinematics simulator with a graphical user interface (GUI).

**Features**

- Calculates position, velocity, and acceleration of an object
- Simulates projectile motion
- GUI for easy input and visualization of results

**Usage**

1. Run the `kinematics_simulator.py` script to use the simulator in the console.
2. Run the `kinematics_ui.py` script to use the GUI.

**Input Parameters**

- `v0`: initial velocity (m/s)
- `theta`: angle of projection (degrees)
- `x0`: initial x-position (m)
- `y0`: initial y-position (m)

**Output**

- Trajectory of the projectile motion, displayed as a list of (x, y) coordinates

**Dependencies**

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (built-in Python library)

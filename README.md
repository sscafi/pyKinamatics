# Improved Kinematics Simulator

## Overview

The Improved Kinematics Simulator is a Python-based application that provides a graphical user interface for simulating and visualizing projectile motion. This tool is designed to help students and educators explore the principles of kinematics in a user-friendly environment..

## Features

- Interactive GUI for inputting initial conditions
- Real-time simulation of projectile motion
- Graphical representation of the projectile's trajectory
- Calculation and display of key motion parameters:
  - Maximum height
  - Range
  - Time of flight
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Ability to clear inputs and results for multiple simulations

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
- matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script:

   ```
   python improved_kinematics_simulator.py
   ```

2. Input the initial conditions:
   - Initial Velocity (m/s)
   - Angle of Projection (degrees)
   - Initial X-Position (m)
   - Initial Y-Position (m)

3. Click the "Simulate" button to run the simulation.

4. View the results:
   - The trajectory plot will appear on the right side of the window.
   - Key motion parameters and trajectory coordinates will be displayed in the text box.

5. Use the "Clear" button to reset all inputs and results for a new simulation.

6. Click "Quit" to exit the application.

## File Structure
